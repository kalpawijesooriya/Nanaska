                     Certainly let me take this opportunity to thank complete team of Nanaska for giving an excellent support during the study of MCS November 2018. I do not have any hesitation in accepting and proclaiming that I am extremely satisfied with the methodology of Nanaska, be it their analysis of case studies, material ,mock papers or personal attention of the principal Channa. & wish that every prospective student must experience the same and pass the exam in their first attempt as I could.

                 The most appropriate word that describes Nanaska is excellence. The Nanaska expertise exposes students to well tailored information that would aid them to excel. I passed my CIMA strategic case study exams on first attempt with Nanaska. I would definitely recommend Nanaska to any student pursuing the CIMA strategic case study exams.

Especially for SCS exam, the group discussions, one-to-one consultations and the mock exams prepared by the team, as well as the reading materials and the podcasts that available in the forum are very relevant and useful for improving our chances of success. Without them, I would not have passed this exam. Kudos for their efforts!

In my first attempt CIMA graded me as moderate in all areas, while my second attempt reflected a substantial improvement with CIMA grading me strong in all with exception of being moderate in technical skills. Channa and team offer excellent preparatory material with emphasis in the right areas incorporated into highly effective mocks. Beyond that as a CIMA gateway student, one should spare the time skimming through the E2, F2 and P2 syllabus, so as not to underestimate the missing knowledge from having been

They played a vital role in developing my thought process and helped me feel the connect with the organisation given in the case study.

                and have forgotten most of the things I learnt but Nanaska gave me
                materials and lectures that made it easy for me to recall those past years and pass
                my exams. Their exam preparation is second to none. Their quiz questions

That was a perfect style to ensuring a good grasp of the case study and its requirements.

The support and guidance from the lecturer has helped me to pass this paper with 102 scores. Setting aside time to study for a professional exam had been a challenge for me. Nanaska's programme provided the flexibility to juggle around my work, family and studies. The weekly follow up sessions are really motivational in terms of keeping you ahead of the game and broaden your thinking. The feed back for mock papers are very useful in identifying the areas where you need improvement and mostly they are followed up in the next papers. The level of support and motivation given to students by Nanaska team is truly amazing!!

                    I took the SCS with a different tutor last year. He spent only one weekend to go over the material; the rest was left to me to figure out. That partnership failed. This year, I went for Nanaska. From the get-go, I knew they were different: website, personal profiles, proper admin, podcasts, etc. Then it came time to deep dive; we met regularly, lots of reading material, and Whatsapp forum. We had webinars every weekend to go over new information and questions from the week. We then progressed to the practice mocks with one-on-one feedback. Success was resounding.                </p>

                    "Before I knew about Nanaska and Mr. Channa, I was the person who does not have the enough level of confidence to pass the CIMA SCS exam. I always thank to Mr. Aung Naing Maung Maung who paved the way to Nanaska and introduced with Channa Sir. With the support of Channa Sir and Nanaska team, through the mock exams, I knew about my strengths and weaknesses of my knowledge and experience to face with real exam. When I sat the real exam, I noticed that I could manage the time and answering points that pushed me to pass the exam. With Nanaska and Channa Sir's support, I could pass the exam. I strongly believe that Nanaska is the place that is secure to pass with the best marks in CIMA exams."

                  Passing exams with a high mark was not an impossible task due the immense support and guidance received from Mr. Channe. An advice for a randomly prompt question or clarification was a few clicks away due to the availability of online support. The podcasts, additional reading material and videos provided a depth of additional knowledge which helped me not only to excel when answering questions but also widened my thinking horizon. Most of all availability of these resources helped me out to be focused on my goal as where ever I was everything was available at my fingertips.

I was hesitant to take any online coaching before for my MCS but finally got to know about LearnCIMA in some social media forum. Mr. Channa is the best with his approach and guidance that made me clear MCS in first attempt and despite hardly preparing because of some personal issues.

I am looking forward for my Strategic level with this team again.

                    The tuition by Channa is the most relevant and focus on the case study as the examiner is looking 
for  a specific answer than  a general one at the SCS level exam.

                <p>The mocks are well covered with the most possible questions relevant to the Pre-Seen and can be 
done under exam condition. Further, all the possible issues are well covered with the short notes for 
easy use during the exam.  </p>

                <p>LearnCIMA was recommended to me by one of the students who qualified through them 
previously. I was initially quite sceptical about an online based tuition provider but could not afford 
the high costs of other providers and took a risk. I must say it was a risk well worth it and I passed 
beyond my expectation. I was a Gateway Student and therefore didn’t have the previous syllabus 
knowledge and was fretting about the F2 paper; however, Channa and his team gave me all the 
confidence I need and was with me to the last moment. The team also provided a perfect work/life 
balance to me and fitted most of the revision sessions around my availability. The course material 
and podcasts provided are excellent! The mock exams and force on my practical thinking were 
another key aspect the team helped me with. Overall I’m very pleased to have chosen LearnCIMA 
and back again with them for Strategic. Thank you Team!</p>

                    I would say, if you haven’t seen anyone applying “Theory of Constraints” live, then LearnCIMA is the place. Secondly, if you are a busy working professional, living with heavy family commitment and can’t spare more than 2 hours a day, then LearnCIMA will aptly suit you to pass CIMA. It may sound an exaggeration but honestly, I am the testimony to their credential. Honestly speaking, due to prior commitments and unavoidable office work, I studied just for 15-20 days and succeeded. I could pass the SCS exam with 81 marks at my first attempt. Although, I presented well, but after the exam, I thought…I could have certainly done better. Nevertheless, I passed no matter what I scored. I owe my success to LearnCIMA and thank them for all the work and support given to me.
                </p>
                <p>LearnCIMA methods were not like any other materials where we just buy a plethora of materials and left to remember. Their study materials are very involving and mock tests are excellent and exam standards. Their pre-seen and industry analysis is very in-depth and nothing actually leaves uncovered. They gave a detailed analysis of possible triggers; podcast, videos, and mock papers and marked feedback were actually fabulous and actually helped me to pass the exam. Mr. Channa is a very engaging coach and he exactly told me where I was going wrong.  You need to believe him. Mr. Channa understands what exactly is required to pass the case study exam and more so what to write and what not. I would not have been able to pass without his advice and guidance.</p>
                <p>From my experience, I would highly recommend CIMA student to go with LearnCIMA if one has to pass with ease, with confidence and with low investment.</p>

You exceeded my expectations in the quality and relevance of you course materials and your 1-2-1 engagements among others. My favorite part was your podcasts!

This means I was behind time in my preparations. That was when my tutor-mentor directed me to Learncima.com and said “Channa and his team can fix this”. And yes, Channa fixed me and so can he and his team fix you too!
</p>
                <p>LearnCIMA course materials are direct and straight to the point. The best part is that the mock exams are more demanding than the real exams ensuring that committed students pass their exams. The exam engine depicts the real exams giving students real-exam feel that boost students’ confidence. I passed at my first attempt.
</p>
                <p>I have recommended LearnCIMA to fellow students and strongly recommend them to all CIMA students taking case study exams at all levels.

                    I would like to thank the wonderful lecturers and staff from LearnCIMA.com for the invaluable support that I received in order to pass the final paper of CIMA program at my first attempt. I registered to study with LearnCIMA.com late but the way lecturers encouraged and inspired students has motivated me having good performance during the studying as well as in the exam. In addition, I found that it was easier to understand some key areas of theory applying for problem solving in the case study because of lecturers' explanation on the key points in the simplest ways. All the best to LearnCIMA.com team.

                    I passed my Strategic case study first time with 85 marks, I only enrolled for the revision course but the individual attention, study materials and revision proved to be very rewarding and although I was not much knowledgeable about the case study and its requirements, LearnCIMA  was able to make me an expert in just a few weeks, I was able to learn the cardinal areas that would help me gain good marks, Thank you LearnCIMA!!!!!!

                    I sat for CIMA’s Strategic Case Study (SCS) in August 2015, and it was my first ever SCS sitting. It was a totally different experience for me, as SCS is a fully computer based examination and with time constraints.<br/><br/>
                    However the team at LearnCIMA assisted to me in migrating (from T4) to SCS with ease. We had a 6 to 7 weeks syllabus implemented via interactive online studies, refresher course on the relevant theories and models, and lots of mocks attempts under exam conditions. Personally I found the weekly tutorial sessions and the audio/video notes on key subjects of a great help. LearnCIMA’s mocks and online sessions were key in building my confidence and knowledge about the case, familiarization with the industry and identifying possible challenges/tasks from the case.<br/><br/>
                    I would like to thank the team at LearnCIMA for their effort in helping me to pass the SCS exam (with flying colours) in my first my first sitting. I must say that my fellow students at TopCIMA/LearnCIMA shared the same appreciation.

                    First of all, I want to thank you for all of your effort to support me to pass the gateway exam of CIMA in May 2015.The best thing in Learncima.com is the mock exam. With 06 mocks which are not only fulfill all of the syllabus but also very close to the real exam, I believe that any student who really do all of them seriously, they will pass the exam 100% whatever the variant is. The speed of feedback is also amazing which help me a lot to review and improve my competences for the exam. Moreover, Learncima.com has also provided many very useful notes in both text and audio which help student can review and understand all of the Managerial level syllabus 2015 easy. All of them are very comprehensive and go straight forward to the adaptation of theory to the case. Even though, there are few drawbacks  such as Channa's accent which can be quite strange for some people, the forum is not very active and they are not provide the pass warranty, this course is excellent in overall. Therefore, I strongly recommend the students of Gateway programs, especially who are exempted by MBA, to join this course. If you work hard enough, 100%, you will pass the exam with the great help of Learncima.com.

I enrolled with STRATEGY PASS after my first attempt of F3 which I failed, after a friend recommended them to me and my next attempt with STRATEGY PASS, I Became a Country Prize winner in F3 with 71%. So it was clear to me that to jump through the hurdle of T4B which was another scary and really worrying part of the CIMA examinations, where I met people who had sat for this exams for 6 times, 4 times , 3 times I just continued with TOPCIMA PASS and I passed the T4B at my first attempt. They are really flexible for any kind of lifestyle and treat you as an individual and have a kind of personal relationship with you and follow up with your progress until the very last day of the exam on a one to one basis. I recommend them to anyone who has no time to waste with re-sitting exams and cannot afford the disappointment of failing papers.

Initially my first mock exam attempt was awful and I became worrie d. But with the assistance of Mr Channa and the TOPIMA team, all the strategies they developed to ensure that students earn all the easy marks and the comprehensive marked mock examinations, I am happy to report that I passed T4 on my first attempt and now form part of the very few people who have managed to finish CIMA in Lesotho. I strongly recommend TOPCIMA. It was certainly good value for money.

                </p>
                <p>
                    What I loved the most is the constant check up they did on me, the constant mock exams helped a lot and not forgetting the one on one Skype chats to address the areas of need. Marking of the Mock papers was very quick and the comments on each area helped mould me. The pod cast are well explained and designed for the particular case study. TCP programme is intense and it did put pressure on me, lots of work to do every week but for a working student like me their time table was very flexible. It was an exciting programme and am glad to say It was my first online class attempt and my first attempt on the paper and I passed.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you Top CIMA Pass for making my dream come true.</p>

I will certainly, without doubt, recommend TCP to any of my work colleagues who may be thinking of doing a T4 Part B for online class. Agreed with TCP tagline of “we will monitor your performance weekly and we will guide you till you go to the exam", as they really follow & guide you closely till the exam day. Also the one-to-one approach that improved your doubt on certain matters will ensure you will always in the right track.

                    Mr. Channa and his team are so dedicated and have proven expertise in every aspect of T4. They have crafted a winning formula that is very easy to understand and manage. All I had to do was put full faith in them and follow the proven method to success. The valuation of mocks with specific feedbacks was very helpful to target my effort to make meaningful improvements. The material provided and the online support was very good and I felt the overall support was better than what I got in the class room tuition from a leading provider in UK. I passed with 37.

                    I had made 2 unsuccessful attempts using another e-learning T4 course provider at almost double the cost of TCP.  After a recommendation from the CIMA regional office, I signed up and was the best thing I did.  TCP allows you to build your own timetable around your commitments, which if you are working are best to keep to a minimum during the 2 months as there is a lot to cover.  Not only do you get written materials but this is supported by podcasts that give you a step by step guide in how to 'play the game' of passing T4.  They also provide plenty of mocks, 8-9, which are and marked, then followed up with a 1 to 1 session to help assist in areas that need improvement, these are invaluable in getting you familiar with what is needed to pass the exam in the tight time frame.

                    The November sitting was a difficult paper which thankfully I passed but doubt that I would have achieved this without the support and guidance from TCP.
                </p>
                <p>I would highly recommend this to any T4 student and wish I had gone with TCP for my first attempt. Thanks and all the best!.</p>

                    I have chosen TOPCIMAPASS.com after reading excellent recommendations on CIMA forum, but more importantly because of the very high pass rates they constantly achieve and because the course was significantly cheaper than other ones.

                    I got much more than I expected –from pre-seen material packed in easy-to-remember presentation, through analysis of possible exam issues, relevant up-to-date industry examples, revision of important theoretical points, up to amazing 10 mock exams with strict time management and personalized feedback. What TOPCIMAPASS.com does is much more than they promise – they analyze every student separately in order to give you exactly what you need to pass. All you have to do is study during this intense, yet flexible course which also provides great work /study/life balance.
                </p>
                <p>TOPCIMAPASS.com proved to be extremely reliable and very serious tuition provider which keeps you focused and supports you in every moment throughout the course up to the exam itself. This was one of the most complete tutorials I ever attended, and I am so grateful because they led me straight to easily passing T4 first time with 31 credits. Thank you guys!</p>

                    My belief is that perfect process leads to perfect result. So far I managed to deal with all previous exams on my own. T4 was different. Here you really need to know what is being assessed and how to achieve balanced report to pass. Topcima provides their own approach in the form of passing strategy and strict timetable to be followed. All the training is designed to recall the technical knowledge and train new – report writing skills. Marked mocks and individual feedback is perfect to be ready on the exam day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recommend Topcima because they know WHAT, HOW and motivate you WHY.

TCP working extremely hard in providing students with high quality mocks, study materials, quick feedback and continue support throughout the course. TCP gives you all you need to pass T4 at first attempt.         Mr Channa is a very good motivator helps you to build confident and make you mentally prepared on what to expect on the exam day.

I attempted T4 three times my own and failed. TCP trained me to complete the exam within the allotted time in a balanced answer, not more or not less content. Also, awesome experience was what we discussed in the mock was the real exam questions (especially mock 7 to 10), so it made easy win. Also, the technique and method was awesome as they trained to score maximum easy marks and motivation and encouragement was keep the spirit alive till complete the exam. You will be given more than they promise definitely!!

                    Thankfully, I choose TOPCIMAPASS as the online course to help me pass the final CIMA T4 exam. This turned out to be a great decision! The moment I joined the course, I felt part of a team. They provide much more than guidance on how to pass the exam.
                </p>
                <p>Their provision of Strategy 56 gives you knowledge of the marking scheme, they encourage you to mark other students anonymous papers to understand further what examiners are looking for, Plan B prepares you for the situation were timing may not be going according to plan, access to podcasts you can listen at a time that suits your busy lifestyle, 1-2-1 feedback on areas for improvement using skype once they mark your mock exams, text messaging to make sure you are keeping up, online materials for focus revision of previous topics and continuous support were all excellent. </p>
                <p>I entered the exam hall feeling extremely well prepared and confident.</p>
                <p>I simply cannot recommend TOPCIMAPASS highly enough. For me no more exams, and for anyone wondering about what course to take, just look at the other testimonials…It’s the best money you will ever spend.</p>

If you want really pass first time I do recommend them! They are providing 24/7 support. It was great experience and on the exam I knew I know all I should to pass it. I think it was first CIMA exam I felt so confident about my knowledge. If you want really pass first time and pay very reasonable price you should choose TOPCIMAPass. There is 24h forum with many students on various topics to get you prepared for the exam. All well organised and the team gives more than you can think of. Very highly recommended!!

                    I am Pavan from India. I am a qualified chartered Accountant as well as cost accountant. I have the passion for CIMA. I came from a back ground where I can't afford high fee for my studies and also I need to support my family too with my earnings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I completed my CIMA up to strategic level through self-study. Upon completion of the same, in the view of the criticality of T4, I decided to take online tuition and I did my own research and shocked to see that tuition fee are very very high and some of the tuition providers charging more than  my 4 months of salary.
                </p>
                <p>Then I came to know about TCP and Channa and his excellent study techniques as well as excellent track record of pass percentages over the years. And the best part is they are providing tuition at a very very cheaper price than any other in the world. Also there are is personal attention over mails, Skype and phone calls and SMS with continuous follow up and motivation. Also TCP giving the maximum mocks than anyone with personalised feedback and suggestions for improvement. This along with Chann's strategy 56 helped me to clear my T4 in my first attempt with 35 credits and All India first rank which given my career a great Boost.</p>
                <p>At the age of 25 years, being young professional at the early stages of career this great achievement given a great boost to my career.</p>
                <p>This is only because of TCP and Channa and his superb study techniques.</p>
                <p>Thank you very much my dear TCP and team for giving me a great professional life.</p>

                    I wasn’t sure which college to attempt T4 with. I had previously studied with other colleges in London but I came across TopCimaPass.com through the forums on CIMA’s website. Everyone had very positive feedback and reviews of TCP. Cost was not an issue as my company was sponsoring me. But having said that TCP, I found, was just about the cheapest on the market, which was a nice bonus.

There are multiple mocks, which are marked, and detailed feedback given on your performance and areas where you need to improve. Further to this there are Podcasts to guide you through the importance of the different sections, and the amount of time needed to complete these sections, based on their point weighting.

                <p>I chose TCP because of the good reviews I read; they were all true. Channa and the rest of the team will provide you with all the tools you need to pass the exam. From valuable insight /tips about how to collect the maximum number of marks from CIMA’s assessment criteria matrix, to loads of practice. And, above all, their personalised approach means that they mark your mocks and answer your doubts really quickly.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, by the time you sit for the exam, you will have done so much practice that you will be well prepared to comment on whatever topic arises. And, also very important, you will have a great control on the time you spend on each section.</p>

                    I can highly recommend topcimapass.com (TCP) for any student who is looking for online tuition provider. After 4 times unsuccessful attempt with self-studies, I registered with TCP for May 2012 exam and passed with 32 (64%) marks in the name of TCP.

                    TCP Golden rule of time management plan, strategy 56 and mocks are very helpful to pass T4 exam easily.
                </p>
                <p>TCP never leave student with study materials. Always encourage us by motivating and monitoring our performance individually by marking mocks and giving individual feedback.</p>
                <p>TCP is providing other all relevant study materials to pass T4. Especially calculation practices, discussion forum, past papers, industry examples, real case issues and industry examples etc.</p>

                    After completing the CIMA Strategic level, I started looking for a T4 tuition provider to get me through the final exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked at the big providers but wanted a provider that would give me the flexibility to study at home but also provide feedback and support when required.
                </p>
                <p>TCP was highly recommended by past students and was also very reasonably priced against other providers, so I signed up for the course and it has been one of the best decisions I have made.</p>
                <p>TCP provide you with a structured learning experience that builds your technique and confidence with a series of mock exams whist also encouraging discussion on the case study industry in a lively forum environment. This made the learning experience more interesting as students would post new relevant information that they had researched and the whole course benefited from the information.  Feedback and coaching is given throughout the course and one to one sessions are also available with the lecturers. </p>
                <p>I have no hesitation in recommending TCP to get you through the CIMA T4 exam.</p>

                    I'd already attempted T4 twice on my own and had failed.    T4 is not an easy paper and it became quite clear to me that I needed outside help.  TCP was getting rave reviews from students on the official CIMA website so I signed up. It was the best move I made!

                <p>
                    TCP is intense yet flexible and fits around your work/life balance.  The tutors work with you to create a personal timetable that can accommodate the reading material, podcasts, online forums and mock exams around your own personal circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>TCP do not just give you material and let you get on with it - they are in touch with you most days via email, the online forums and also Skype chats if required.  The key to passing this paper is mock exam practice and applying TCP's 'Strategy 56' - the technique I used to help me pass T4.  They are one of the cheapest online providers in the market and are committed to each and every student.</p>
                <p>I thoroughly recommended studying with TCP - it will be the best investment you make throughout your CIMA studies.</p>

                    I have chosen TOPCIMAPass after the recommendation of my friend and the positive reviews on the CIMA forum. The online course was a new kind of experience because I have never done any e-learning course before. TOPCIMA offered me very individual approach with very strict schedule of all learning steps which should be done in order to pass the exam. There were a lot of examples given during the course and a lot of attention. There were also a few mock exams which were marked and followed with the detailed feedback. Additionally the course has very good price. Comparing to traditional courses I had the opportunity to learn and practice without any rush (two days before exam I spent walking and visiting London) I have passed in the first attempt and got 27 marks.

                    I was lead to choose TOPCIMAPass as my tuition provider by all the positive reviews on the CIMA Forum and they were not wrong. TOPCIMAPass helped me to pass T4 on the 3rd attempt with 56%.After using a tuition provider for the first two attempts and spending over £1000 and to receive a result of 46% both times was very hard - as I had put in so much work. At a fraction of that cost, TOPCIMAPass marked three of my mocks with detailed feedback and this helped me to learn step by step, where exactly I needed to improve. This was the key for me to pass the exam. Thanks you to Channa, Wathsala and all the TOPCIMAPass team for encouragement, professionalism and personal attention.

                    After a number of unsuccessful attempts of sitting T4, I decided to register with TOPCIMAPass.com in 2011.  I am happy to say I was not disappointed!  The level of service you receive from TCP is second to none.  You are guided throughout the whole course and receive continuous support.  I narrowly missed the September sitting but with some kind words from Wathsala and further exam practice with the high quality mocks provided, I managed to get 29 credits in November 2011.  The feeling of getting that email to say you’ve passed is indescribable.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are willing to put in the work, TCP will support you all the way.  We were given a total of 11 mocks for the November exam as well as numerous calculation practice examples from TK.  These all really help to build confidence, improve your exam technique and timing; three of the most crucial issues to overcome in nailing T4.  I even did an additional mock at the last minute which TCP kindly marked for me and sent back straight away!  I can’t think of many other places where you would get service like this.  TCP are a solid provider, from their excellent admin function to high quality teaching, materials, support and efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>T4 is definitely a ‘different beast’ to the other CIMA exams.  However, with hard work, perseverance and a quality tuition provider like TCP you are sure to find the recipe for success!</p>
                <p>To all the TCP team – I cannot thank you enough.</p>

                    I can recommend TOPCIMAPass to any student who is looking for an excellent online tuition provider. I used to do self study up to my strategic level papers. I attempted T4 two times and failed with 18 and 19 marks before joining TOPCIMAPass. I realised that something is seriously missing in my answers that examiner is looking for. TOPCIMAPass helped me a lot to sharpen my thinking process which is vital for a pass in T4 exam. TOPCIMAPass teaches you how to produce an answer which ensure you a pass. As Channa said while trying to make one part of your answer perfect means you are losing your precious time for making a fair attempt on another part. TOPCIMAPass will teach you with their mocks how to win this game of race against time that is what T4 is all about.

They offer 24\7 support, plenty of mock papers with full answers but most importantly they give you speedy personalised feedback which is invaluable as preparation for this exam. The course also represents exceptional value for money when compared with other online tuition courses. I passed the Nov 2011 T4 paper with 28 credits having previously failed with 17 and 19 credits respectively. This huge increase in marks is down to the excellent service that the whole TOPCIMAPass team offers to their students.

We had 11 Mocks which other institutions can’t much and we learnt different ways of tackling whatever scenario is brought on the exam day.

                    I had given two sittings for T4 earlier by studying on my own and the last attempt was three years ago (failed with 24 credits :() . I just thought might be I can give it one final try before dropping it forever. I came to know about TOPCIMA through various CIMA forums. Their pricing was also reasonable so I thought why not give it a try. I am glad I did so. I really liked their systematic approach. The regular follow up to check if we are on track really motivated me and kept me on track. Interaction with other students motiavted me and gave me confidence. Considering that my last attempt was three years ago and that I had studied under earlier syllabus I needed lot of help to brush up on the basics. They not only guided on the current case study also had articles to brush up what I had studied earlier. Topcimapass.com made me enter the exam feeling I CAN DO IT. My happiness knew no bounds when I cleared the exam with 34 credits. I am finding it difficult to believe even now :) Thank you topcimapass.com. You made me do it.  I sincerely recommend this to all students.

                    I passed T4 at 32 marks in Sep 2011. I must say, I could not achieve it without the great help of TCP team.
                </p>
                <p>I knew TOPCIMAPass.com from http://community.cimaglobal.com. I saw there were a lot of students recommending it as T4 online study partner. I am in China with very few face to face T4 tuition providers. Even there is, the course is quite expensive and most likely cannot begin per schedule due to too less enrollee. So I registered at TCP immediately when I found it. It was really great experience studying with TCP. They issued 6 mock papers for Sep 2011 sitting, which almost covering every major topic of supermarket and sustainability. They also provided intensive calculation practice related to the Papy case. And their amazing 56 marks strategy works so well! </p>
                <p>In my view, TCP is coaching students to make the complex and difficult exam to simple and easy. Study with TCP, you are never alone. You may share ideas, experiences with fellow students all over the world on the forum. You never know how valuable points you may get from them.</p>

Thank you Angela, Channa and Wathsala and rest of the TOPCIMAPass team for your encouragement, personal touch, professionalism and persistence!! I passed in spite of a very busy work and family life.

                    TOPCIMAPass.com helped me in approaching the T4 case study exam in a professional way. In any touch professional exam you need to train yourself to score maximum technical points. TOPCIMAPass team helped me in approaching the answers in a methodical way covering the various areas on which students are marked. The mock exams were very helpful in learning and gave me the confidence to take the main exam. Due to this on the main exam day I found myself more confident and was able to succeed.

                    I found out about TCP through a friend and I was, at first, somewhere apprehensive about online studying verses classroom courses and, if truth to be told, suspicious about the low fee in comparison to other classroom tuition providers.
                </p>
                <p>Choosing TCP proved to be one of the best decisions I made as a CIMA student. Finding a work/study balance is always a challenge but TCP provide you with a great deal of flexibility in your study by tailoring the course to you as an individual. The quality of the learning aids are excellent particularly Channa’s podcasts and the forum enables you to benefit a great deal from the other students on the course. General exam feedback was plentiful and proved invaluable. You can tell that these guys have been doing this successfully for some time now and I would sincerely recommend TCP to any other student who is serious about passing TOPCIMA</p>

                    I passed with a pleasing 33/50, at the third attempt which was the 1st with TCP. I managed to improve 46% to 66%. I have to give full credit to TOPCIMAPass.com. The course was really good, cannot recommend enough. I did 6 mock exams and got the results for each within one or two days, the feedback on the mocks was superb and much focused. I had more feedback from each single mock exam than I had from two previous courses in total. I had previously sat with a well known UK provider, but this course was a fraction of the price and the support was virtually one to one. I also found it really enjoyable. I don’t usually leave many postings but I think that I owe it to Channa and Angela, I wish them every success in the future and thank them for their part in mine. Excellent! Give it a try…… you will not regret it!

                    Despite being a dedicated self studier for the other levels, it soon became clear that T4 required some expert tuition. Signing up with TOPCIMAPass.com was the best preparation I could have received. I took your marked mocks, which steadily improved form the low 40’s to 56%. Thanks to the feedback, coaching and materials from TOPCIMAPass.com. I am so happy to have passed T4 at the first attempt with 58%.

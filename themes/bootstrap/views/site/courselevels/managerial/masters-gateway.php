            <p>The CIMA Gateway Exam is also known as the Management Case Study Exam, for those who are not on the accelerated route.
            Both Management Case Study students and Gateway students have to face the same paper in the exam.
            Therefore we have designed a special familiarization of management level theory areas for Gateway students to make
            sure candidates are capable of facing the examination with ease. All required theories of E2, P2 and F2 will be
            discussed in the familiarization module.</p>

            enabling it to be covered in the short time duration and it would also be comprehensive enough to cover all required
            areas for the case study exams.</p>
            <p>Familiarization of theory will be conducted throughout the session and more focus will be given on areas that are
            likely to be tested in the exam.</p>
